# GenUKminiproject - cafe ordering app
• A 6-week mini-project using Python to develop a simple app that lets the user make and edit orders.

# Project Background
• The client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district, 
offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. 
• As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.

# Client requirements
As a business, the client wants the following app capabilities:
• Maintain a collection of products and couriers.
• Create a new order on the system when a customer makes an order.
• Update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.
• All data to be persisted and not lost when app is exited.
• Load all persisted data when app is started.
• Ensure app has been tested and proven to work well.
• Receive regular software updates.

# How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
• Weekly edits to program design in accordance with client specifications.
• Setting design targets to achieve every week.

# How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
• Extensive testing of key functions for output errors.
• Use of error handling where user input was required.

# If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
• Loading and persisting data to a database using SQL.

# What did you most enjoy implementing?
• Source control using Git
