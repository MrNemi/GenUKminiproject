# Data Engineering miniproject - a cafe ordering app.
• A 6-week mini-project using Python to develop a simple app that lets the user make and edit orders.

# Project Background
• The client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district, 
offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. 
• As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.

As a business, the client wanted the following app capabilities:
• Maintain a collection of products and couriers.
• Create a new order on the system when a customer makes an order.
• Update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.
• All data to be persisted and not lost when app is exited.
• Load all persisted data when app is started.
• Ensure app has been tested and proven to work well.
• Receive regular software updates.

# How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
• Weekly edits to program design in accordance with client specifications.
• Setting design targets to achieve every week.
• Reaching out to the client for further details on any ambiguous requirements.

# How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
• Testing project code for bugs.
• Use of error handling where user input is required.
• Using a checklist for different stages of project design.

# If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
• Dependency injection and mocking of core functions.

# What did you most enjoy implementing?
• Source control using Git
